Project Name: USA HOUSING
Build a system for tracking orders, products, customers, and payments for an e-commerce platform.
Introductions:
•	SQL: Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), querying datasets, and performing aggregations.
•	Power BI: Creating dashboards, interactive reports, and visualizing key insights.
•	Python: Data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and machine learning for price prediction.

SQL 5 QUESTION
1.Average House Price by State "What is the average house price for each state?
2.Top 5 Most Expensive Houses?
3.Total Number of Houses in Each City. How many houses are listed for sale in each city? 
4. Correlation Between House Price and Square Footage. "What is the average price per square foot?"

PowerBI: 
Power BI is a Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Visualization tool developed by Microsoft. It helps users connect to various data sources, transform data, and create interactive reports and dashboards.

CONCLUSIONS:
	To provide conclusions for a USA housing report using SQL, Power BI, and Python, we typically follow a structured analysis pipeline involving data extraction (SQL), data analysis and modeling (Python), and data visualization (Power BI). Here's a set of general conclusions and insights one might draw from such a project, assuming a comprehensive dataset.
